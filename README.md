# Cardiocare_Pro
"Cardiocare Pro" is a university project created by Di Biasi Yuri, Marrone Christian and Salzano Giuseppe, with the aim of detecting potential abnormalities in heart rate using an image classification model, in particular by processing images of electrocardiograms

The project revolves around:

1.Search for a Suitable Dataset for the Application:
One of the initial steps involves searching for an appropriate dataset that aligns with the application's objectives.

2.Training a Machine Learning Model using a Convolutional Neural Network Developed from Scratch:
The project involves training a machine learning model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is designed and implemented from the ground up. This CNN will play a crucial role in the application's functionality.

3.Development of an Android Application using Android Studio:
The final phase of the project entails creating an Android application using the Android Studio integrated development environment. This application will serve as the user interface for the machine learning model, providing a user-friendly experience for its intended purpose.
